## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt about using adding an image over another image, creating an invisible element using css. I learnt how to add an horizontal line in html and styling it in css. I was able to remove the border and give the line a thickness and also change the color from the default color. In general, I understood the idea of the mobile first approach and why it is very important. I feel great, and looking forward to adding even more nft cards or even building a complete nft website.

```html
<div class="card_details">
        <a href="#"><h3>Equilibrium #3429</h3></a>

        <p>Our Equilibrium collection promotes balance and calm.</p>
        <div class="price_time">
          <h4><img src="./images/icon-ethereum.svg" alt="" /> 0.041 ETH</h4>
          <p><img src="./images/icon-clock.svg" alt="" /> 3 days left</p>
        </div>

<!-- adding horizontal line to webpage -->
        <hr style="color: #0c1c2e" />
```

```css
/* This was a really big deal for me...I literally yelled yes! when I got how to style the hr tag that has always proven difficult. Thanks to the internet. */


hr {
  height: 2px;
  background-color: hsl(215, 32%, 27%);
  border: none;
}

```


### Continued development

I still need to understand when to use the justify and align features of the css flexbox and how to use them properly. I also wasn't able to implement the eye icon on the active state. I'll keep learning to know how to manipulate that with html and css.


### Useful resources

- [Positioning image above another](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-position-one-image-on-top-of-another-in-html-css.html) - This particularly proved useful while I was trying to place the eye icon over the nft (equilibrum) image.

- [Styling hr tag](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html/how-to-change-the-color-of-an-hr-element.html) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand ow to style the hr tag. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
